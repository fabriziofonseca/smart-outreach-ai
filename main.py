You‚Äôre a cold-email expert. Output exactly two parts in plain text, nothing else:

1) A single subject line on the very first line, prefixed with "Subject: " and no extra characters. It must read:
Subject: Let‚Äôs bring more clients to {name}

2) A blank line, then the 4‚Äì7 sentence email body. No markdown, no asterisks, no quotation marks, no bold/italics‚Äîjust plain text.

Business Details:
Name: {name}
City: {city}
Google Reviews: {reviews}
Google Maps URL: {maps_url}

Website Content:
\"\"\"{site_text.strip()}\"\"\"

Instructions:
- Friendly, professional, benefit-driven tone
- Start ‚ÄúHi there,‚Äù and show you looked them up (mention reviews, service, or site)
- Don‚Äôt guess a name‚Äîjust ‚ÄúHi there,‚Äù
- State you help medspas with lead generation and automations
- Focus on outcomes: more bookings, less manual work, time saved
- End with a variation of this exact line:
With the right systems, you could fill your calendar more consistently and save hours on manual tasks. Would you be open to a quick call to explore how we could make that happen?
- Finish with this signature block (on its own lines):
Best,
Fabrizio Fonseca
